A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a category of probabilistic model which states that all generated data points are derived from a mixture of a finite Gaussian distributions that has no known parameters. 
The parameters for GMM are derived either from maximum a posteriori estimation or an iterative expectation-maximization algorithm from a prior model which is well trained. 
Gaussian mixture models are very useful when it comes to modeling data, especially data which comes from several groups.

# GMM_1
In this part, we will classify a simple data set "IRIS Data Set" provided by sckit-learn, contains information on iris flowers.
To keep things simple, we're just looking at the first two columns (the length and width of the sepals).

# GMM_2
In this part, we will perform a classification of a set of images of cars and boats.
